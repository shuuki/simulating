#SIM DEMO: THREE

Flying around in space. Going for zero gravity/friction mechanics in a very agile light ship.

Keyboard controls to get oldschool space sim vibe:

- W/S = back/forward
- R/F = up/down
- Q/E = pitch left/right
- Arrow up/down = pitch down/up
- Arrow left/right = yaw left/right
- Space = brakes
