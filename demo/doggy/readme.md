#SIM DEMO: DOGGY

Build of dog RPG encounter system. Outputs an ASCII map to the page, open up the JavaScript console to see the sim in progress.

Doggy walks in a procedurally generated landscape until encountering another animal. There's squirrels and bears and rabbits in this version. There's only one instance of each, they just encounter each other again and again until the doggy dies. Sometimes the doggy kills them, but they're not taken out of the sim in this version so their zombies continue to attack until the doggy dies. Something to fix in a later version.
